# Machine Learning
This is just a collection of some small ML projects in R and Python that I did during my Master's.

Among others it includes a quick application of hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering, as well as kernel k-means.
In MLP vs RF I used Bayesian Optimisation to tune the Hyper parameters of the Neural Network.
The third one compares kernel ridge regression with a Gaussian process and a quick discussion of some common GP kernels.
